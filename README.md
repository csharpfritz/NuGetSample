# NuGetSample

A sample PCL package to help demonstrate how to write a NuGet package that can be used across multiple platforms.  Designed for maximum 'F5-ability' so that you can download, compile and start using it immediately.

BUT... you don't realy want to use the contents of this package.  This package contains some simple code that isn't really the focus of this sample.  The focus is on the packaging and distribution of this code as a nupkg.
